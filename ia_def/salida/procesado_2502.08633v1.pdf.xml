<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ferroelectric HfO 2 has garnered significant attention for its promising application in high density nonvolatile data storage and nanoscale transistors. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO 2 limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. The ongoing debate centers on whether HfO 2 is a proper or improper ferroelectric, as it exhibits characteristics of both types. In this study, we utilize symmetry-guided first-principles quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations to accurately map the energy landscape and identify the coherent switching pathway of HfO 2 by voltage. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, ferroelectricity in HfO 2 is driven by a triggered mechanism through coupling between the stable polar mode and hybrid non-polar modes. Second, unusually high polarization arises from the hybrid modes, which consists solely of non-polar modes. The results fundamentally transforms the perspective on polarization in HfO 2 and resolve conflicting characteristics observed, offering valuable guidance for superior technological applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since the discovery of ferroelectricity HfO 2 -based thin films <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, it has been heralded as a promising candidate for future ferroelectric technologies for its compatibility with existing silicon technology, stable ferroelectricity down to subnanometer thicknesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, and minimal domain-wall energy cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In addition to serving as a potential high-density memory storage medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, it offers lower power consumption operation in transistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. HfO 2 also exhibits distinctive electromechanical properties, setting it apart from traditional ferroelectric materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>While the ferroelectric phase of HfO 2 has been identified with the orthorhombic space group Pca2 1 (#21), the origin of ferroelectricity in this phase remains elusive. This lack of understanding limits the ability to effectively control certain unfavorable properties, such as the high coercive field, slow domain wall propagation and formation of of non-ferroelectric phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In general, the origin of ferroelectricity can be classified as either proper, where polarization results from an unstable structural mode (phonon) with polar symmetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or improper, where it is driven by one or more unstable non-polar modes through their coupling with the polar mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. HfO 2 exhibits characteristics that both align with and challenge aspects of each mechanism.</p><p>The absence of a polar structural instability, specifically the Γ − 4 mode, suggests that the ferroelectricity in fluorite HfO 2 (Fm 3m, #225) is improper in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Several other factors also support this theory. No anomalies are observed in the Born effective charges <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and depolarization field isn't effective in suppressing the polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Also, out-of-plane polarization is induced when an in-plane tensile strain is applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, suggesting strong polar and non-polar mode interactions. However, the couplings necessary for improper ferroelectricity are forbidden in fluorite structure.</p><p>This observation led to proposal of proper ferroelectricity in HfO 2 . Notably, HfO 2 -based thin films are not reported to encounter the same challenges in electric switching associ-ated with improper ferroelectrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and a drastic dielectric enhancement is observed near the ferroelectric transition temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Alternative pathways to ferroelectricity have been suggested, involving lower symmetry parent structures such as the Pmab phase (#57) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and the Pcnb phase (#60) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Recently, the proper ferroelectricity of HfO 2 and ZrO 2 has been attributed to the softening of the transverse optical mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. However, the explanations of proper ferroelectricity in HfO 2 falls into one or more following categories, each with certain limitations. They require either a parent structure that is much higher in energy, or substantial strain, or polar phases that differ from the experimentally observed Pca2 1 . Importantly, the proposed mechanisms for proper ferroelectricity do not explain the antiferroelectric-ferroelectric continuity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> in flourite systems and instead result in paraelectricity when ferroelectricity is suppressed.</p><p>There are other explanations for ferroelectricity in HfO 2 that do not fit into the categories of proper or improper ferroelectrics. One notable mechanism is by the negative biquadratic coupling between polar (Γ − 4 ) and non-polar mode (X + 5, ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, spontaneously through large tensile strain induced along one of the in-plane axes which is reported to induce the non-polar mode instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A trilinear coupling of modes derived from the parent phase P4 2 /nmc was also identified as the origin of ferroelectricity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The polar phase of ZrO 2 , which shares the same symmetry, has been investigated and attributed to non-linear interactions between the + 5 modes too, represented by a spline function <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. While these studies offer valuable insight, there is no consensus on a model that explains the ferroelectricity in HfO 2 . In this study, we employ symmetry-guided expansions of energy and polarization by Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> with first-principles density functional theory (DFT), which have proven successful in modeling and elucidating the novel origins of ferroelectricity in many systems, such as multiferroic hexagonal manganites <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> and Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. This methodology and our results reveal two key, previously unreported findings. First, ferroelectricity in HfO 2 is driven by a "hybridtriggered" mechanism involving multiple trilinear and quadlinear couplings of stable modes. Second, the hybrid zoneboundary modes, consisting of a combination of multiple symmetry-modes, exhibit exceptionally high polarization, contributing over -50% of the bulk value and offering novel properties from previously unexplored interplay between dipoles. We begin by analyzing the crystal structure of the polar phase of HfO 2 (orthorhombic Pca2 1 ) by decomposing the difference between it and the high-symmetry reference structure (fluorite Fm 3m) into the symmetry-modes. There are eight relevant modes, which are labeled by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the parent space group as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. 0 denotes the order parameter of the polar zone-center mode (Γ − 4 ), while the remaining parameters, , correspond to non-polar zone-boundary modes. 4 represents the only unstable mode ( − 2, ) which has non-zero amplitude in the centrosymmetric Aeaa (#68) phase. The Aeaa phase is a more likely candidate for the non-polar structure of HfO 2 under tensile strain than the frequently assigned P4 2 /nmc (#137) phase according to the energies from DFT (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), consistent with the experimentally observed changes in aspect ratio and interlattice spacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>The wavevectors of the zone-boundary modes in the reciprocal space are essential for understanding couplings between them (fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). These wavevectors are not necessarily parallel to the direction of ionic displacements in real space; for instance, the ionic displacements of 1 are along the direction, while the wavector points to the direction. Unlike previous studies that label the modes by ionic displacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, we label them by their wavevectors.</p><p>Combinations of order parameter amplitudes that remain invariant under all symmetry operations of the space group (and hence transform as the Γ + 1 irrep) constitute the most general invariant polynomial. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> lists the unique mode couplings that are present in this polynomial. Only terms derived from these couplings contribute to the LGD energy in its Taylor expansion around the high-symmetry phase. Consequently, the energy landscape of ferroelectric HfO 2 can be adequately represented using these terms up to a sufficient order, and insight about the mechanism behind ferroelectricity can be extracted from it.The second-order terms are limited to simple quadratic or bilinear terms of the same irreps. In the third order, there are only trilinear terms that can be divided into two forms: ΓX X couplings (involving one Γ-point mode and two X-point modes of the same wavevector) and X X X couplings (involving three X-point modes of different wavevectors). Similarly, quadlinear terms include ΓX X X and X X X ′ X ′ categories. While there are other fourth order terms, they do not play an important role in reducing the symmetry, and hence we do not list them in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>.</p><p>With these insights, we now proceed to explore the origin of ferroelectricity in HfO 2 , where trilinear and quadlinear couplings provide a pathway for what we dub "hybridtriggered ferroelectricity". For simplicity, we introduce a following expression of electric enthalpy <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> using hy-Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Hybrid-triggered ferroelectricity. Energy-polarization (left), polarization-voltage (middle), and order parameterspolarization (right) relations of hybrid-triggered ferroelectrics: (A) modeled using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>, and (B) incorporating an additional coupling term 1 3 4 . The presence of this additional coupling significantly reduces the critical polarization required to induce triggered ferroelectricity. (C) DFT-calculated energies of HfO 2 , illustrating hybrid-triggered ferroelectricity. The results compare scenarios where all other order parameters are fixed to zero (left) and fully relaxed (right).

We consider the case where all coefficients are as positive, thus there is no soft mode or negative biquadratic coupling that can give rise to ferroelectricity. The sign of does not matter, since it is determined by the definition of the zone boundary order parameters.</p><p>An example of solution to Equation 1 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>. Below a critical value of the polar order parameter, | 0,c | = √ 1 2 /| | (Supplementary Text), the system behaves as a dielectric with no contribution to energy from the trilinear coupling. This region is shown with blue lines. However, once | 0 | exceeds | 0,c | by application of voltage, the hybrid mode 1 2 becomes unstable inducing a phase transition to the polar phase where both 1 and 2 condense simultaneously (shown in red lines)-similar to the "avalanche" transition in Aurivillius compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and the predicted transitions by quadratic-linear couplings <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The simplest explanation to this phenomenon is that 0 acts as a tunable coefficient for second-order hybrid mode term 1 2 . We refer to the pretrigger phase as the dielectric phase and the post-trigger phase as the "triggered" phase.</p><p>A key distinction exists between improper and triggered ferroelectricity, though both arise from couplings between polar and non-polar modes. Improper ferroelectricity involves unstable non-polar modes-either single or hybrid <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>coupled to the polar mode. As a result, olarization switching in improper ferroelectrics requires changing the direction of a non-polar omode present in the structure which introduces an energy barrier that does not directly couple with applied voltage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Triggered ferroelectricity, by contrast, does not rely on unstable modes. It arises from couplings of hard nonpolar modes with the polar mode (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3</ref>). When polarization surpasses a critical threshold, for example due to an applied electric field, hybrid modes condense and the system moves to a different global minimum of energy. Unlike either proper and improper ferroelectricity, the mechanism underlying triggered ferroelectricity requires no additional instabilities.</p><p>This fundamental difference renders triggered ferroelectrics more useful for applications than improper ferroelectrics as well. For example, the energy barrier associated with switching of a non-polar order parameter is absent in triggered ferroelectricity. The triggered mechanism also aligns with the observed dielectric increase upon heating, akin to a first-order transition between ferroelectric and dielectric phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Notably, this is the only mechanism proposed so far that is compatible with the continuous evolution of antiferroelectricity to ferroelectricity in ZrO 2 -based thin films <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p><p>-plot of Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref> shows existence of two distinct critical voltages, derived from the dielectric phase, and from the triggered phase. In the case where transition to the dielectric phase during polarization switching is merely transient ( &lt; ), it results in a ferroelectric hysteresis. Conversely, if the dielectric phase persists and manifests as a non-transient  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and (B) Hybrid improper ferroelectrics. The former switch though a barrier nonparallel to 0 axis, while the latter encounter an intrinsic energy barrier parallel to the 0 axis associated with the switching of either one of the non-polar modes, which does not directly couple with voltage. state during polarization switching ( &gt; ), it leads to the formation of an antiferroelectric-like double hysteresis.</p><p>Our DFT calculations also confirm the triggered ferroelectricity in HfO 2 . The modes of HfO 2 0 , 1 , and 5 exhibit symmetries consistent with those suggested by Equation 1. We set all other displacements to zero and compute the crystal's energy as a function of the hybrid mode 1 5 , maintaining a fixed ratio between 1 and 5 , while 0 is held at progressively increasing values. The resulting energy plots are displayed in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>, where the critical value for triggered ferroelectricity is | 0,c | is 0.49 Å. When 0 is below this threshold, the hybrid mode increases the energy of HfO 2 . For 0 exceeding 0.49 Å, the energy of HfO 2 begins to decrease as a function of increasing hybrid mode order, revealing the hybrid mode instability.</p><p>Nevertheless, attributing the emergence of ferroelectricity solely to a single trilinear coupling term 0 1 5 proves insufficient, as the calculated value of | 0,c | is higher than the spontaneous 0 in the ferroelectric Pca2 1 phase, | 0,s | = 0.40 Å. It turns out that all the trilinear and quadlinear couplings contribute to the triggering mechanism in HfO 2 , except for 0 2 4 , 1 3 5 6 , and 1 3 5 7 . If two trilinear or quadlinear couplings share a hybrid mode component that is inactive pre-trigger, they can condense simultaneously with reduced 0,c (Supplementary Text, equation S13). This is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, where the addition of trilinear term Even after addressing the roles of multiple trilinear and quadlinear couplings, an important aspect of this transition remains unexplained. As demonstrated in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, when the DFT energy of HfO 2 is accurately plotted as a function of the polar order parameter, a cusp emerges in the curve. This cusp is does not appear in our demonstrations of hybrid-triggered ferroelectricity so far, as it is not a feature necessarily derived from the mechanism itself. A major contribution to this energy cusp is from an underappreciated factor which also connects to the origin of strong trilinear couplings in HfO 2 : the polarization arising from hybrid non-polar modes themselves. The hybrid modes 1 5 , 2 4 , 3 6 , and 3 7 , which couple with the polar mode in HfO 2 , break all the inversion symmetries present in the crystal and transforms exactly as the polarization itself (Γ − 4 ) (table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). The broken inversion symmetry from non-polar modes is a well-established characteristic of hybrid-improper ferroelectrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Typically, the combination of two non-polar modes leads to a nonzero amplitude of the polar structural order parameter, which is the only significant source of polarization. The case of HfO 2 does not fit in to this usual scenario. The polarization of HfO 2 from DFT in its ferroelectric Pca2 1 phase under 1% epitaxial tensile strain is 0.56 C/m<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> . The contributions from the hybrid modes 1 5 , 2 4 , pects of the phase transition. Not only are there overlapping regions of polarization in the transition pathway, but also the voltage and the order parameters in these overlapping regions are discontinuous, resulting in a disruptive phase transition where all the order parameters abruptly shift as polarization increases.</p><p>The energy plotted as a function of 0 and provides further insight into this transition. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>, bottom right). When is zero, the data in this plot is restricted to a onedimensional line, as cannot assume a value different from 0 , and vice versa. However, when is non-zero, each variable, and 0 are independent. Two distinct local minima emerge in this plot: the dielectric phase where the hybrid mode is inactive, and the triggered phase where they condense. As increases, the triggered phase's local minimum separates more from the = 0 line, eventually disconnecting entirely from the dielectric phase's local minimum. Thus, a slight increase in polarization above causes a sudden jump in all order parameters, including 0 . The pathway from the triggered phase to the dielectric phase differ from the pathway from the dielectric phase to the triggered phase as the local minima are completely separated, leading to overlapping polarization regions and additional hysteresis in the switching pathway.</p><p>We apply these insights to HfO 2 under 1% epitaxial tensile strain to map the complete coherent ferroelectric phase transition pathway. From the coefficient obtained from the regression of DFT energies to LGD theory (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>), we generate the plots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>. The critical polarization is 0.30 C/m 2 . In the dielectric phase without applied voltage, only 4 is non-zero; upon applying voltage, 0 and 2 condense. At 0.47 V/unit cell (u.c.), ferroelectricity is triggered, causing a simultaneous jump in five other order parameters. The voltage needed to switch polarization is higher than the triggering voltage, reaching about 1.4 V/u.c.. The separation of two local minima is clearly visible in the two-dimensional energy landscape. Note that the proper ferroelectric switching pathway via the Pcam (#57) phase is also observed from this model, but requires higher voltage of 2.3 V/u.c., and is geometrically restricted in non-periodic boundary conditions. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that HfO 2 will switch through the Aeaa phase via the hybrid-triggered mechanism.</p><p>Finally, one critical question remains: what makes the hybrid modes so polar? The answer lies more in the fluorite structure itself rather than in a unique property of the Hf-O bonds. In fact, the Hf-O bond is relatively simple electronically due to the high electropositivity of Hf, compared to bonds such as Ti-O which are known to enable ferroelectricity in perovskites through hybridization <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Although the Hf-O bond is mostly ionic, it gains more covalent character as the Hf-O bond length decreases. This results in bond-to-bond charge transfer associated with ionic displacements in each mode. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> shows a (010) plane of oxygens ( = 0.75) and surrounding Hf atoms in the conventional cell. When ions displace according to − 4 or 3 , charge transfers towards + between the Hf-O bonds in the upper half, and towards − in the lower half. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref> shows this charge transfer from DFT, in the form of cuts of charge density change on Hf-O planes. The opposing direction of charge transfer between bonds results in a overall non-polar structure.</p><p>However, if ions then displace according to 2 or − 7 starting from the distorted structure by − 4 or 3 , charge is transferred upward around each oxygen ion in the crystal, as the charge transfer from the shortened bonds surpasses that from the extended bonds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5C</ref>). This results in a significant downward polarization purely from electronic dipole effects, without any ionic contribution. This aligns with the observation that the Born effective charges are enhanced by only relatively relatively small amounts in the high-symmetry phase, but they are dramatically different in different phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The nontrivial sources of polarization in this system lies not in the first derivatives with respect to displacements, but in the second derivatives. Also this purely electronic dipole, coupled with an oppositely oriented ionic dipole, can enhance the stability of ferroelectricity in ultra-thin HfO 2 , as the depolarization field from one polarization source stabilizes the other, further strengthening the trilinear interaction.</p><p>Our findings fundamentally transform the traditional interpretation of polarization in oxides as a linear function of charged ions' displacements, especially in HfO 2 . For example, HfO 2 was thought to consist of non-polar spacer layers and polar layers, based on the displacement of oxygen ions along the direction. Our findings show that HfO 2 can exhibit substantial polarization even in the absence of ionic displacements along . The discovery of multicomponent hybrid-triggered ferroelectricity combined with the large polarization arising from hybrid modes resolve longstanding questions about the ferroelectric behavior of thin-film HfO 2 and lays the foundation for superior ferroelectric applications.</p></div>
