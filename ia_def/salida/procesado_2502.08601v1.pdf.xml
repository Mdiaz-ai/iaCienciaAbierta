<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In optoelectronic applications, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are compelling materials because of their highly tuneable and intensely competitive optical properties. Colloidal synthesis enables the controlled formation of various morphologies of MHP nanocrystals, all with different carrier properties and, hence, different optical and carrier transport behaviours. We characterized three different methylammonium lead tribromide perovskite (MAPbBr3) morphologies: nanoplatelets (NPLs), nanosheets (NSs), and nanostripes (NSTs) synthesized by hot-injection synthesis protocols with slightly different parameters. A fluorescence imaging microscope (FLIM) for time-and spaceresolved measurements of the carrier migration was employed to quantify the charge carriers' migration process upon photoexcitation. The results are rationalized in the two-dimensional diffusion model framework,</p><p>considering funnelling and trapping processes in mixed-𝑛 colloidal MHPs. Subdiffusion mode was found to prevail in the nanocrystals, whereby the highest carrier diffusivity was found for bulk-like NSTs, followed by layered NSs and a film of NPLs. These findings provide a better understanding of optoelectronic processes in perovskites relevant to photovoltaic and light-emitting devices.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Metal halide perovskites (MHP) are promising materials for the next generation of optoelectronic applications, such as light-harvesting devices, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The high potential of MHPs in optoelectronics is firmly grounded in their diverse and excellent properties, such as high defect tolerance and carrier mobility, combined with the possibility of tuneable optical properties. These properties instil confidence in the reliability and performance of these materials and pave the way for exciting advancements in optoelectronic perovskite applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> The general chemical formula of MHPs is L2[ABX3]n-1BX4. In the unit cell, six octahedrally arranged halogen metal atoms (e.g., bromide, iodide) represented by the X surround the divalent cation B (e.g., lead). Organic spacer cations A (e.g., methylammonium, formamidium, etc.) stabilize these metal-halide octahedra and ensure charge neutrality (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Surface ligands (L) isolate the MHP from the environment, building a protective shell to improve the MHP's lifetime and stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The ligands can also cause the MHP to have a layered structure, separating single ABX3 layers from each other with thickness 𝑛 described by the number of BX3 layers. This quasi-two-dimensionality positively affects stability and causes changes in physical properties, such as increased exciton binding energies and enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The effective band gap of the MHP shifts with increasing 𝑛 to lower energies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Therefore, a mixed-𝑛 layered MHP structure enables a funneling process, where excitons migrate to higher layer numbers with a low band gap. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> The exciton binding energy increases by lowering 𝑛, while free charge carriers dominate bulk MHPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Colloidal synthesis based on the hot-injection technique efficiently controls the MHP design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> In this report, we use colloidally prepared (C12H27N)2(MA)n-1(Pb)n(Br)3n+1 (hereinafter referred to as MAPbBr) nanoplatelets (NPLs), nanosheets (NSs), and nanostripes (NSTs) with dodecyl amine (DDA) as ligands to investigate the influence of the MHP's inner structure and shape on the diffusion behavior affected by the type of charge carriers and their recombination mechanics.</p><p>The applicability of optoelectronic perovskite devices critically depends on carrier properties, as well as their diffusion dynamics. Recent studies investigated exciton diffusion in two-dimensional MHPs, finding a subdiffusion behaviour mainly restricted by inner traps or exciton-phonon interactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> The diffusivity was measured using a transient photoluminescence microscope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> It was found that dissociated free carriers cause long diffusion lengths in MHP single crystals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> The diffusivity of carriers within MHPs can be expressed by the diffusion coefficient 𝐷. We used a double-path confocal fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM) with a separation of the excitation and the detection path for time-and space-resolved mapping of the carrier migration, which provided input for the calculations on the diffusion coefficient 𝐷.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carrier Diffusion Measurements in Different MAPbBr Structures</head><p>MAPbBr perovskites have long carrier diffusion lengths because of a high defect tolerance and carrier mobility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The MHPs considered in this study are colloidally synthesized MAPbBr NPLs, NSTs, and NSs obtained in a hot-injection synthesis procedure with slightly changed parameters to obtain the different inner structures and shapes (Supplementary Information 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>-d shows all three morphologies as transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. The NPLs have a mean lateral size of 50 nm. The edge length of the NSs varies between 2 to 5 μm. The NSTs have an average width of 35 nm with a length of up to 10 μm. The sizes along 𝑥and 𝑦-directions in the NPLs, NSs, and NSTs are larger than the exciton Bohr radius ≃ 3.8 nm for bulk MAPbBr. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Hence, confinement effects can only arise from the inner layered structure. Compared to the NSs, the carrier diffusion in the NPLs is restricted in the 𝑥and 𝑦-directions by the edges of the structures. The diffusion is restricted to the 𝑥-direction for the NSTs. The lifetime characteristics and space-and time-resolved charge carrier diffusion are measured with a double-path confocal FLIM (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a-c</ref>  The lifetimes are visualized by the colour scale and weighted by the number of counts. The NPLs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>) show a uniform intensity, only reduced in areas where there are no NPLs, and a lifetime of 𝜏 av = 26 ns at an excitation fluence of ≈ 1.06 μJ/cm 2 over the whole field of view.</p><p>The intensity distribution over the single NS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) is not uniform, indicating differences within the structure, which will be discussed later.

This higher excitation fluence was necessary because of the low quantum yield from a single NST.</p><p>The corresponding diffusion maps are shown in the lower row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> with the same Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.field of view as for the lifetime measurements. The excitation spot is fixed and in the centre of the blue spot. From this point, the movement of the charge carrier distributions can be tracked. Here, the time colour scale contains the carrier lifetime and diffusion time and is optimized to reveal a better view. The intensity weakens far from the excitation centre because long lifetime carriers diffuse further but is pronounced here for better visibility. While the diffusion of the charge carriers in the NPLs and NSs is quasi uniform in the lateral direction, appearing circular on the map, the NST reveals the bidirectional charge carrier migration manifested in elliptical intensity distribution. FLIM measurements enable dividing pictures into consecutive time steps. Because of a low intensity, single time frames are binned to images of 2 ns. A Gaussian distribution fits the forward diffusion broadening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Isotropic diffusion is assumed for the NS and NPL, meaning equal broadening in the 𝑥 and 𝑦-direction.</p><p>Therefore, the variance 𝜎 𝑥 2 (𝑡) = 𝜎 𝑦 2 (𝑡) represents the broadening over time 𝑡. The NST also show a bidirectional diffusion but is strongly limited in one direction by the edge of the NST (Supplementary equations</p><p>(1), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the fitted distribution of radiatively recombined carriers for NPLs, NS, and NST after different times 𝑡 (raw data can be found in Supplementary Information 4). The broadening of the Gaussians is clearly visible. The intensity decreases over time due to the migration concentric from the excitation spot and recombination of the charge carriers. For further clarity, the insets show the current broadening and diffusion distance determined by the difference between subsequent slices (Supplementary Information 5). An intensity &lt; 0 (blue) represents recombined carriers, whereas leaving carriers by further diffusion appear in the regions where the intensity is &gt; 0 (red). Time lap videos visualize this diffusion and can be found in the Supplementary Information. and represents the change of leaving (&lt; 0) and arriving (&gt; 0) carriers. In the area in between, recombining and diffusing carriers are in balance (0, grey). The outer grey area is also 0 since there are no charge carriers.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, differences in diffusion become apparent when comparing NPLs, NSs, and NSTs. Accordingly, NSTs show the longest diffusion length, followed by NSs and NPLs. In this study, the charge carrier dynamics in MHPs will be analyzed quantitatively using the general diffusion equation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> With this, the measured intensity of the two-dimensional exciton density distribution 𝑛(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) for monomolecular and bimolecular recombination can be described.</p><p>𝑛̇(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) = 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) + 𝐷𝛻 2 𝑛(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) − 𝑘 1 𝑛(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) − 𝑘 2 𝑛(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (1)</p><p>with 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) as the particle (charge carrier or excitons) generation term. For 𝑡 = 0, the initial laser excitation is a Gaussian with a width of 245 nm according to the resolution limit and the given geometries by the setup. For 𝑡 &gt; 0 𝐺(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) = 0 applies. The monomolecular or bimolecular recombination rates are 𝑘 1 , representing recombination due to excitons or trapped charge carriers, and 𝑘 2 , recombination of free carriers, respectively. The diffusion is determined by the diffusion coefficient 𝐷.</p><p>To apply this equation to the measured NPLs, NS, and NSTs carrier diffusion and to determine the differences in the diffusion behaviour, further knowledge about the MHPs is needed. Therefore, additional measurements were done to disclose the inner structure, type of carriers, and recombination mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of the MAPbBr Structures</head><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to characterize the inner structure. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a-c</ref> shows strong reflections from the MAPbBr single-crystal (100) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) directions for all three investigated MHP morphologies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Some peaks are not visible due to the texture effect because of the planar orientation of the nanocrystals on the substrate. In the NPLs and NSs, additional peaks below (100) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) are visible and assigned to the mixed-𝑛 layered structure of the MHPs with layers of 𝑛 = 2,3, … ∞, where 𝑛 = ∞ describes a bulk structure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> The contribution from higher 𝑛 layers is more pronounced in the NSs. In the NPLs, artifacts from the layered structure are also visible. The fact that these peaks are broader than those of the NS is due to the fact that the NPLs are thin and hence not all layered but single layers meaning low 𝑛. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> The NSTs are composed entirely of bulk crystal structures.</p><p>The type of carriers was examined by steady-state ensemble absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements in solution. The absorption and the PL spectra are normalized to their maximum and shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d and e</ref>, respectively. The central emission peak is at 𝜆 em = 515 nm for all three structures.</p><p>Therefore, this peak must be assigned to a bulk structure with high 𝑛 since it is the lowest energy gap for the carriers to recombine, and the NSTs are bulk only. These results suggest carrier funnelling from regions with low 𝑛 (higher energy states) to regions with higher 𝑛 (lower energy states) in the layered NSs and NPLs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Since the DDA ligands used in the synthesis are short (12 carbon chain length compared to 14 (tetradecylamine) or 16 (hexadecylamine)), they support the funnelling process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> The NSs also show smaller shoulders at shorter wavelengths. Here, the radiative recombination of the charge carriers happens before relaxation to the lowest energy, which is a sign of separated layer domains with low 𝑛. These shoulders are not dominant in the NPL and NST emissions, indicating the possibility of complete relaxation to the bulk and recombination at low energy.</p><p>As mentioned in the lifetime picture, the intensity distribution over the single NS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) is not uniform.</p><p>The number and combination of mixed layers between the distinguishable bright and dark regions can differ.</p><p>Since the excitation wavelength is at 𝜆 = 440 nm, electron-hole pairs can be generated only in layers where the optical gap is below ≈ 2.81 eV, which could lead to a disadvantage in excitation for regions with low 𝑛 which have a larger bandgap (2.91 eV for 𝑛 = 3 for NSs) as discussed below and therefore showing low PL intensity there. The lattice structure of MAPbBr is considered as mechanically soft leading to strong electronphonon interactions which are even more pronounced in layered perovskites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> This energy transfer to phonons can explain the reduced PL intensity at spots where 𝑛 is low.</p><p>In the absorption spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>), strongly pronounced exciton peaks above the bulk band gap energy 𝐸 g are visible for the NPLs and NSs. Since every layer 𝑛 has its own band gap energy and continuum states these absorption peaks support the layered structure from the XRD measurements. Since there is more than one peak in the absorbance spectra, different MHPs can have different thicknesses or a mixed-𝑛 layered structure. The positions of the absorption peaks fit with previous studies and can be assigned to layers of 𝑛 = 2 to 𝑛 = 8, while higher layers are supposed to be bulk structures (Supplementary Information 6). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Since those peaks are not pronounced in the absorption spectrum of the NSTs, they are again confirmed to have predominantly a bulk-like structure. A multiple Elliott model fitting helps to extract the exciton binding energies 𝐸 b and band gap energies 𝐸 g of the different layer components and is explained in the Supplementary Information 7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> The NSs exhibit four exciton peaks for energies above the bulk band gap. However, the maximum exciton binding energy for the NSs is 𝐸 b = 98.5 meV for the highest measured exciton peak with a band gap energy of 𝐸 g = 2.97 eV. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Because of this high 𝐸 b , the dominant carriers in the NSs are assumed to be excitons.</p><p>The maximum binding energy for the NPLs is 𝐸 b = 156.4 meV for the peak with a band gap of 𝐸 g = 2.81 eV <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Since there is practically only bulk for the NSTs, only the contribution at the lowest energy band gap was fitted, leading to 𝐸 g = 2.38 eV and 𝐸 b = 19.9 meV, which is still below the room temperature E = k 𝑏 T ≈ 25 meV. Hence, excitons will dissociate to free charge carriers and are expected to be the dominant species in the NSTs for all excitation energies at room temperature, in contrast to NPLs and NSs where excitons are formed in the dominate exciton peaks of low 𝑛. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Measuring the fluorescence lifetime with a FLIM enables a more detailed examination of the charge carrier  The intensity PL 0 at the maximum of the decay curves is plotted over the excitation fluence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>). the exciton binding energy decreases with increasing layer number 𝑛 and is faster or comparable to trapping in defects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Free charge carriers would show a bimolecular recombination behaviour, where 𝑏 ≈ 2. Hence, the funnel paths occur as quasi-traps at the 𝑛-𝑛'-interfaces. This explains the slope as being slightly higher than one. The NSTs show 𝑏 = 1.662 ± 0.013 and are closer to a bimolecular recombination process indicating free charge carriers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> The slope 𝑏 &lt; 2 can be considered as a fingerprint of defect-trapped charge carriers recombining in a monomolecular mode.</p><p>The division of PL 0 by the laser fluence can be determined as the relative PLQY rel , which also characterizes the present charge carrier dynamics (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5c</ref>). Again, the power law can be used for fitting PLQY rel = 𝐴 • 𝑃 laser 𝑐 and leads to a slope of 𝑐 = 0.178 ± 0.026 and 𝑐 = 0.145 ± 0.028 for the NPLs and NSs, respectively which can be well explained within the monomolecular regime. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> In the NSTs with three times larger 𝑐 = 0.655 ± 0.023 bimolecular recombination dominates. 39</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carrier Diffusion Dynamics in Various MAPbBr Morphologies</head><p>Knowledge about the inner structure, type of carriers, and recombination mechanisms in the considered NPLs, NS, and NSTs allows to differentiate the diffusion behaviour (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which can now be characterized. For this, we numerically solved equation ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) in one dimension with the finite difference method and used a cross-section of the data as a compare function in a Python minimization method (Supplementary Information 10). Additionally, a two-dimensional fitting for the NPLs and NSs was done to verify the numerically fitting (Supplementary Information 11).</p><p>From the fitting we obtained the diffusion constant 𝐷 and the two recombination rates 𝑘 1 and 𝑘 2 . The monomolecular recombination 𝑘 1 was in the same order of magnitude for all morphologies, while the bimolecular recombination rate 𝑘 2 was higher for the NSTs <ref type="bibr">(10 -4</ref> ) than for the NPLs and NSs <ref type="bibr">(10 -6</ref> ). Therefore, the monomolecular recombination mechanism predominates in the NPLs and NSs, as discussed above in the lifetime considerations, and confirms the quasi-trapping character of the funnelling. In contrast, in the NSTs where the 𝑘 2 is larger, bimolecular and monomolecular decay mechanisms happen side by side, which also goes hand in hand with the previous observations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows the fitting results for the diffusion constant 𝐷 at different laser intensities. The diffusion constant 𝐷 is highest for NSTs, followed by NSs and NPLs. Although the NPLs and NSs show similar structure and carrier dynamic characteristics, the diffusion constant of the latter is slightly higher. The reduced 𝐷 of the NPLs could be due to hopping between particles in the film hampering diffusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Even though the NSTs cannot be assigned as a pure one-dimensional sample and carriers can diffuse in both lateral directions 𝑥 and 𝑦, the diffusion is strongly limited in one direction. For this purpose, the diffusion constant was halved to be comparable with the definitive two-dimensional diffusions of NPLs and NSs.</p><p>(Supplementary Information 10). However, the NSTs show the highest diffusion constant 𝐷. The free charge carriers are mainly responsible for a higher diffusion constant than NPLs and NSs. Another reason for the difference between the bulk and layered structures is the funneling paths in the latter. As discussed, the funnels could act as quasi-traps at the 𝑛-𝑛′-interfaces, hindering carrier diffusion.
