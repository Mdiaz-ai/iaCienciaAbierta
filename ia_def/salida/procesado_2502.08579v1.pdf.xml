<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have revolutionized the fabrication of lead-based perovskite solar cells, but they remain underexplored in tin perovskite systems. PEDOT is the material of choice for hole-selective layers in tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs), but presents challenges for both performance and stability. MeO-2PACz, the only SAM reported for Sn perovskites, enables device fabrication but consistently underperforms when compared to PEDOT. In this work, we identify that MeO-2PACz's limitations arise from excessively strong interactions with perovskite surface and poor lattice matching, leading to poor interface quality. To overcome these issues, we design, synthesize, and characterize a novel SAM-forming molecule called Th-2EPT. Th-2EPT optimizes coordination strength and improves lattice compatibility, contributing to the creation of a high-quality buried interface and dramatically suppressing non-radiative recombination. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to evaluate coordination strength and lattice compatibility, complemented by nanosecond-resolution optical characterization techniques to confirm significantly reduced interfacial recombination and enhanced carrier lifetimes in Th-2EPT/Perovskite films. With Th-2EPT, we demonstrated the first SAM-based tin perovskite solar cells to outperform PEDOT-based devices, delivering a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.2% with a DMSO-free solvent system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Thanks to their simple processing, bandgap tunability, and defect tolerance, perovskites are on track to radically change the world of photovoltaics. However, two significant issues must be addressed before this technology can be considered competitive for commercialization: long-term stability and lead toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . Intense research is focused on developing non-toxic alternatives to mitigate the toxicity issues of lead-containing perovskites <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Tin perovskite solar cells are potentially even more stable than their lead-based counterparts, exhibiting negligible ion migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Despite their potential, TPSCs underperform compared to their lead counterparts, hindered by rapid crystallizationdefective thin films 2 due to the facile oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ , and poor energy-level alignment between standard selective contacts and the absorber layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Until now, in most studies on tin perovskite solar cells, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, in short PEDOT:PSS, has been the hole-selective layer (HSL) of choice, despite the significant energetic misalignment, acidity, and hygroscopicity that limit the performance of PEDOT-based devices and lead to device degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) present a promising alternative to PEDOT due to their dual role in interface passivation and charge selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . While SAMs have demonstrated success in lead-based perovskites by improving charge extraction and passivating interfaces, their application in tin perovskites remains underexplored. To the best of our knowledge, MeO-2PACz is the only SAM successfully employed for tin perovskites, achieving moderate power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.8% <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and 9.4% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , achieved with a DMSO-free and DMSO solvent system, respectively. In any case, SAM-based solar cells have yet to outperform PEDOT controls, and the underlying causes of poor performance remain unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> . In this work, we employ a DMSO-free solvent system for tin PSCs to mitigate solvent-induced degradation, addressing two key challenges: the oxidation of Sn²⁺ by DMSO and the presence of residual DMSO, which can further promote oxidation over the device's lifetime. Furthermore, we use first-principles calculations to identify the limitations of MeO-2PACz, revealing its strong interaction with the FASnI3 lattice and dimensional mismatch as the cause for a highly defective interface. To overcome this incomaptibility between the MeO-2PACz and tin perovskite, we design and synthesize a novel SAM molecule, {2-[3,7-di(thiophen-3-yl)-10H-phenothiazin-10-yl]ethyl}phosphonic acid or Th-2EPT, featuring two thiophene passivating head groups, a phenothiazine core and a phosphonic acid anchoring group. Th-2EPT significantly improved the interfacial quality of tin perovskites by enhancing lattice matching and fine-tuning interaction strength. Ultra-fast time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy revealed significantly longer carrier lifetimes and reduced defect density for Th-2EPT, demonstrating its ability to suppress trap states and passivate the buried interface.</p><p>Leveraging these improved optoelectronic properties, devices with Th-2EPT achieved a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.2% with a DMSO-free solvent system and EDA0.05FA0.95SnI₃ as absorbing layer. This work marks the first successful attempt to fabricate a SAM-based DMSO-free tin perovskite solar cell that outperforms PEDOT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>In Pb-based perovskite solar cells, MeO-2PACz is commonly employed as one of the most efficient hole-selective materials available <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . On the other hand, the effects of SAM passivation on Snbased perovskite have never been studied in detail, and the underperformance of MeO-2PACz for this material remains a puzzling challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . This observation led us to hypothesize that a problematic interaction between MeO-2PACz and tin perovskite might be the source of this underperformance.</p><p>We investigated whether MeO-2PACz could be incompatible with the lattice, thereby inducing a distorted and defective buried interface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . We further postulated that the key to improving interfacial quality and suppressing interfacial recombination is not maximizing interaction strength, but rather achieving an optimal level, strong enough to passivate intrinsic interfacial defects, yet not too strong to interfere with perovskite growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . In addition to interaction strength, we identified lattice matching as a critical factor. Poor lattice matching between the substrate and growing perovskite can result in structural defects and significant lattice strain at the interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . An even worse scenario arises when a poor lattice match is coupled with a strong SAM-perovskite interaction.</p><p>In this case, the two factors can amplify negatively, leading to a strained and defective interface. To investigate this further, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze lattice matching and binding energy of MeO-2PACz with the FASnI3 perovskite lattice. Afterward, we performed the same calculations on a newly synthesized phenothiazine-based SAM molecule called Th-2EPT. In this section, we compare MeO-2PACz and Th-2EPT, simultaneously evaluating interaction strength and lattice matching with Sn perovskite and the interplay of these factors. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, both molecules present two functional head groups, methoxy groups for MeO-2PACz and thiophenes in Th-2EPT. Both groups can behave as Lewis bases and interact with an undercoordinated Sn 2+ ion in perovskite <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . In this case, the Sn 2+ ion acts as the Lewis acid in forming a Lewis acid-base adduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . A graphical representation of this interaction is provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. Due to the highly electronegative oxygen atom, the methoxy groups present a localized electron density and bind strongly with Sn 2+ . Thiophenes instead bind more weakly because of the less ionic bonding environment and sulfur's lower electronegativity. To extract a quantitative value for the bond strength, the two molecules were modeled on a SnI2-terminated surface of FASnI3 perovskite, calculating the binding energy of the molecules through their head groups. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> shows the molecules' interaction on the FASnI3 lattice with the DFT-calculated binding energies for both SAMs. MeO-2PACz exhibits a higher binding energy of 0.45 eV, attributed to the strong, polar nature of the O-Sn coordination. In contrast, Th-2EPT shows a weaker binding energy of 0.14 eV, reflecting the lower electronegativity of sulfur and the slightly less polarized interaction with Sn 2+ . Our calculations confirmed the hypothesis that MeO-2PACz forms strong bonds with Sn²⁺, but its poor lattice compatibility compromises its effectiveness. This results in a weaker binding with Sn 2+ , potentially allowing for more bond flexibility. To complement the binding energy analysis, the geometric compatibility and lattice matching of the terminal head groups of the SAMs with the perovskite lattice are evaluated. The geometric analysis of lattice matching is based on the hypothesis that SAMs interact with perovskite by forming Lewis adducts between the SAM's head groups (methoxy or thiophene) and undercoordinated Sn 2+ . Head groups are two in each molecule, so the case where both bind to an Sn 2+ ion is the most favorable. In this scenario, the possibility that the distance of the head groups between each other coincides with two neighboring Sn 2+ ions is evaluated.</p><p>For this reason, every combination of the nearest Sn-Sn couple in the perovskite lattice is assessed and compared with the characteristic distances of head groups in the SAM molecules. In the perovskite lattice, the distance to the n-th neighbor is given by the formula 𝑑 = 𝑎 𝑛 + 𝑛 + 𝑛 , where a is the cubic lattice parameter, and nx, ny, nz are the relative directional vectors. The characteristic dimensions of the perovskite lattice and the molecules are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> and lattice match. It is important to note that the calculation considered the nearest neighboring ions in all directions for a cubic 3D lattice, so this consideration is very general and independent of lattice orientations. In this section, we have determined through theoretical considerations and calculations that, while MeO-2PACz forms stronger bonds, it shows an inferior lattice match with FASnI3 perovskite. Conversely, Th-2EPT achieves superior lattice matching and a weaker but more flexible bonding. We postulate that this combination of factors might be decisive for forming a high-quality interface. In the following sections, measurements on films and solar cells are performed to support this hypothesis further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optical characterization</head><p>To assess the quality of the interface and further investigate the differences induced by different substrates, we initially analyzed the dependence of Voc with light intensity to extract the ideality factor. We conducted static and time-resolved photoluminescence, as well as photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at different excitation densities and optical transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), on perovskite films deposited on glass and on perovskite grown on the selective layers.</p><p>PEDOT was included as a reference in this stage of the study, given its role as the most well-known hole selective layer (HSL) in FASnI3 solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . First, Voc dependence on light intensity was measured to extract the ideality factor, which quantifies deviation from ideal diode behavior and it is a useful index of non-radiative recombination at the interface. While an ideal cell has n=1, tin perovskite solar cells can show high ideality factors due to intense bulk and interfacial recombination.</p><p>By measuring Voc across varying light intensities, the ideality factor was extracted using an equation easily derived from the diode equation in open circuit conditions: 𝑛 =</p><p>. The extracted values for n resulted in 2.86, 2.18, and 1.98 for MeO-2PACz, PEDOT, and Th-2EPT, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>). The lower ideality factor with Th-2EPT is an indicator of reduced non-radiative recombination as it is closer to ideality. Then, photoluminescence decay were measured on half stacks of ITO/HSL/Perovskite, to investigate mainly the HTL/Perovskite interface. PL transients show a clear difference in decay times between the extraction layers, with Th-2EPT showing the slowest decay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). trPL data was then fitted with a bi-exponential decay model (fitting parameters and plots provided in Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref> of the supporting material) and the fit was used to the compute differential lifetimes t = -{d ln[f(t)]/dt} -1 , where f(t) is the time-dependent photon flux. In this model, the plateau visible for all curves after the first rise represents a visualization of the carrier lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>). Reaching the plateau at only 33 ns, PEDOT records the shortest lifetime, followed by MeO-2PACz, which exhibits a lifetime of 63 ns, while the film on Th-2EPT achieves a longer lifetime of 93 ns. The perovskite grown on quartz exhibits a lifetime of 156 ns -an impressive value for tin perovskites -thereby confirming the exceptional quality of the thin films synthesized in this study.</p><p>Following trPL, Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed to further study recombination mechanisms in the films. TAS measures the relative change in transmittance of the material (photobleach) as function of time after the material is photoexcited. The resulting signal is proportional to the population of holes and electrons in the VB and CB, respectively. This enables tracking not only radiative recombination (as observed in time-resolved photoluminescence), but also carriers that follow non-radiative pathways. With a temporal resolution of about 300 fs TAS allows to study excited states and their recombination dynamics up to microseconds. For this measurement, the samples were illuminated from the HTL side and a 343 nm laser was employed to obtain an excitation profile predominantly localized at the interface, due to the low penetration depth of low wavelengths in perovskite. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>, the carrier dynamics are extracted at the photobleach maximum (around 850 nm -full spectra available in the supporting material in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>) . A similar trend to trPL is observed, with perovskite on PEDOT showing fastest decay and the SAMs MeO-2PACz and Th-2EPT achieving longer lifetimes, close to the perovskite grown on glass. Notably, a trapped carrier contributes indirectly to the TAS signal by leaving an unbalanced charge in the other band. This produces a long-lived signal (in the microseconds time-range) that is proportional to the density of trapped carriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . Indeed, in the microseconds range, the TAS signal decays quickly for Th-2EPT, while such signal is enhanced in the case of MeO-2PACz <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . This result further supports the beneficial role of Th-2EPT in defect passivation and interaction with perovskite while it also strengthens the hypothesis of the he PL quantum yield (PLQY) as a function of excitation density, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref>, reveals an improvement in radiative efficiency at low excitation densities for perovskite films deposited on MeO-2PACz and Th-2EPT. This suggests effective interface passivation, in contrast to PEDOT, where the radiative efficiency is consistently reduced across all excitation densities, as evidenced by the normalized data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">SI 12b</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solar Cell Fabrication</head><p>To validate the theoretical predictions and assess the real impact of the SAMs on device performance, we fabricated solar cells incorporating MeO-2PACz, PEDOT, and Th-2EPT as hole-selective layers and tin perovskite EDA0.05FA0.95SnI3 as the absorber.. Our approach avoids the use of DMSO, which despite being the most commonly used solvent for preparing tin perovskite, has also being identified as one of the sources of the Sn 2+ oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Instead, we employed a solvent system composing of a mixture of DEF (N,N'-Diethylformamide) and DMPU (N,N′-Dimethylpropyleneurea) Among the candidates, the phenothiazine-based Th-2EPT demonstrated superior performance, achieving a record efficiency of 8.2% and surpassing MeO-2PACz (4.5%) and PEDOT (7.1%).The device architecture consists of ITO/HSL/DMSO-free Sn Perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag, where the HSL was varied between the three materials. Spin-coating and dip-coating were evaluated for Th-2EPT, with superior results obtained via dip-coating. The solar cell performance is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, which shows champion J-V curves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>), EQE spectra (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>), Voc boxplots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>), and PCE boxplots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>). Th-2EPT demonstrated improved short-circuit current density (Jsc), delivering 18.8 mA/cm² compared to MeO-2PACz (14.9 mA/cm²) and PEDOT (18.4 mA/cm²). Incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed on champion pixels from the J-V plots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) to investigate this improvement. The IPCE spectrum confirmed the high Jsc of Th-2EPT devices, with a value of 18.97 mA cm -2 , compared to 14.99 mA cm -2 for MeO-2PACz and 17.67 mA cm -2 for PEDOT (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>). The EQE spectrum highlights the superior quantum efficiency of Th-2EPT, particularly at shorter wavelengths (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>), with an exceptionally high internal photonto-electron conversion at 400 nm, far exceeding PEDOT and MeO-2PACz devices. Short wavelengths in the range 350-450 nm have low penetration depth in perovskite and are readily absorbed in the first nanometers, in the proximity of the HTL/Perovskite interface. For this reason, a substantial IPCE improvement at low wavelengths suggests improved interface quality and reduced non-radiative recombination at the Th-2EPT interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . Open circuit voltage (Voc) is also significantly enhanced in Th-2EPT devices compared to PEDOT and MeO-2PACz. Champion Voc values of 0.63 V, 0.57 V, and 0.50 V were recorded for Th-2EPT, PEDOT, and MeO-2PACz, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>). Overall, Th-2EPT champion devices outperform PEDOT and MeO-2PACz in all solar cell parameters. Fill factor and short circuit current boxplots are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref> of the supporting information. These findings highlight the superior passivation properties of Th-2EPT, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of tin perovskite solar cells compared to conventional hole-selective layers. With 8.2% PCE ourTh-2EPT champion device is a record to the best of our knowledge for SAM-based, DMSO-free tin perovskite solar cells. Moreover, this PCE value is also very close to the all-time record PCE for p-i-n DMSO-free tin perovskite solar cells, which is 8.7% from our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Displayed with a grey star in plot e) there is the highest PCE obtained with a SAM in a DMSO-free perovskite solar cell, from the work of Aktas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we demonstrate that precise engineering of interfacial interactions is key to minimize buried interface losses and achieve efficient tin perovskite solar cells. We synthesize and characterize a new hole-selective SAM, delivering efficient p-i-n DMSO-free tin perovskite solar cells able to outperform current PEDOT devices. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the superior performance of Th-2EPT stems from a an optimal balance between lattice compatibility and coordination strength. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Molecular structures of MeO-2PACz and Th-2EPT.
